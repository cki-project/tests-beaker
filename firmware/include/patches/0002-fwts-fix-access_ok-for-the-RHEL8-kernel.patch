Subject: fwts: fix access_ok for the RHEL8 kernel

The RHEL8 4.18 kernel backported a fix from the 5.0 kernel which changes
the number of arguments for the access_ok macro.
fwts handles this for the upstream kernel by checking the kernel version
as 5.0 or bigger, but this fails for RHEL8 since it runs a 4.18 patched
kernel.
To fix the issue for RHEL8, use the modified macro for kernel 4.18
kernel as well.

This breaks the usage with non-RHEL8 kernels between 4.18 and 5.0, but
this is done to keep the solution simple for now.
