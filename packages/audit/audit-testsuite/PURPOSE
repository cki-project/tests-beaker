Description: Execute audit-testsuite
Author: Ondrej Moris <omoris@redhat.com>

This test executes audit-testsuite. By default, test download upstream
audit-testsuite from github [1] and execute all tests. Optionally, you
can specify the following test parameters:

  * TESTS       - set of tests to be executed,
  * GIT_URL     - URL to alternative git repository (eg. fork from the upstream),
  * GIT_BRANCH  - checkout specific branch for test execution, useful for downstream
                  tests and tests not yet merged into master branch.
  * DEBUG       - execute debugging shell after tests execution (for manual 
                  execution only)
