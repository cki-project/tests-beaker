# basic_pmtu

Steps:
1. set the same mtu A on Client, Router1 and Server
2. set lower mtu B on right side of Router0
3. ping Server on client with packet size C(B<C<A),and with DF flag
4. check route to server on client
5. repeat 3
6. ping server with packet size less than B
7. wait for 10 minutes, and check route again

Expected result:

3. ping get message:message too long, DF flag set
4. mtu of route from client to server changed to B
5. get message: local message too long
6. ping sucessfully
7. route has been reverted to normal(mtu is not B any more)

# setting of ip_nopmtu_disc

Steps:
1. create topo and set ip_nopmtu_disc to 1
2. repeat 1 and 2 in basic_pmtu
3. repeat 3 in basic_pmtu
4. change ip_nopmtu_disc to 0
5. repeat 3
6. check route

Expected result:

3. ping failed with no message
5. ping get message:message too long, DF flag set
6. mtu of route to server become B

# setting of mtu_expires

Steps:

1. repeat 1 and 2 in basic_pmtu
2. set mtu_expires to 60
3. repeat 3 in basic_pmtu
4. check route
5. wait for 60s and check route

Expected result:

4. mtu of route become B
5. route revert to normal

# ip route mtu lock

Steps:

1. repeat 1 and 2 in basic_pmtu
2. add route to server with mtu lock
3. repeat 3 in basic_pmtu

Expected result:

3. ping succeesfully

# different mtu for each route

Steps:
1. set MTU A for Client and Server
2. set MTU B to Router0, set MTU D to Router1, D<B<A
3. ping server with packet size C(B<C<A) with DF flag
4. check route
5. ping server with packet size E(D<E<C) with DF flag
6. check route
7. ping server with packet size F(F<D) with DF flag

Expected result:

3. ping get message:message too long, DF flag set
4. mtu of route becomes B
5. ping get message:message too long, DF flag set
6. mtu of route becomes D
7. ping sucessfully

# delete route

Steps:
1. repeat 1,2,3 in basic_pmtu
2. delete route to server
3. check route to server

Expected result:

3. no route found to server

# Tcp traffic

Steps:

1. start tcp connection
2. change route mtu
3. check connection status

Expected result:

3. connection is still on and file transmitted completely
