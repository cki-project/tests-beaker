Keep-Alive Process:
There are three configurable properties that determine how Keep-Alives work. On Linux they are1:
    tcp_keepalive_time
        default 7200 seconds
    tcp_keepalive_probes
        default 9
    tcp_keepalive_intvl
        default 75 seconds
TCP keepalive works like this:
    Client opens TCP connection
    If the connection is silent for tcp_keepalive_time seconds, send a single empty ACK packet.1
    Did the server respond with a corresponding ACK of its own?
        No
            Wait tcp_keepalive_intvl seconds, then send another ACK
            Repeat until the number of ACK probes that have been sent equals tcp_keepalive_probes.
            If no response has been received at this point, send a RST and terminate the connection.
        Yes: Return to step 2
This process is enabled by default on most operating systems, and thus dead TCP connections are regularly pruned once the other end has been responsive for 2 hours 11 minutes (7200 seconds + 75 * 9 seconds).

This test case:
Use socket options to overide the system's, and test keepalive process.
TCP_KEEPIDLE	---->	tcp_keepalive_time
TCP_KEEPCNT		---->	tcp_keepalive_probes
TCP_KEEPINTVL	---->	tcp_keepalive_intvl
