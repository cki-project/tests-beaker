This test is used to detect if System Management Interrupts (SMIs) are
causing event latencies in the Linux RT kernel.

The module hwlat is a special purpose kernel module that is
used to detect if System Management Interrupts (SMIs) are causing event
latencies in the Linux RT kernel.

SMIs are usually not serviced by the Linux kernel. They are set up by
BIOS code and are serviced by BIOS code, usually for critical events
such as management of thermal sensors and fans. Sometimes though, SMIs
are used for other tasks and those tasks can spend an inordinate
amount of time in the handler (sometimes measured in milliseconds).
Obviously if you are trying to keep event service latencies down in the
microsecond range, this is a problem.

Note that the SMI detector should *NEVER* be used in a production
environment. It is intended to be run manually to determine if the
hardware platform has a problem with long SMI service routines.

Usage: smidetect [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --duration=DURATION   total time to test for hardware latency (<n>{smdw})
  --threshold=THRESHOLD	value above which is considered an hardware latency
  --window		time between samples
  --width		time to actually measure
  --report=REPORT	filename for sample data
  --cleanup             force unload of module and umount of debugfs
  --debug               turn on debugging prints
  --quiet               turn off all screen output


An example run looks like this:

   $ sudo hwlatdetect --duration=2h
   hwlatdetect:  test duration 7200 seconds
     parameters:
           Latency threshold: 1us
           Sample window:     5001000us
           Sample width:      1000us
        Non-sampling period:  5000000us
           Output File:       run/hwlatdetect-2h.dat

   Starting test
   test finished
   Max Latency: 74us
   Samples recorded: 3
   Samples exceeding threshold: 3
