PURPOSE of /kernel/distribution/ltp/include
Description: Linux Test Project - include part

LTP Introduction
================
LTP is a famous test suite under Linux, I port
LTP to Beaker every 4 months (+/-1 month if
needed). You can use this testcase for your
RHEL testing.

What's this
===========
This is a include testcase, you should include
it in your own ltp projects.

HOW TO USE IT
=============

1. What you should put in your own Makefile:

 - include /mnt/tests/kernel/distribution/ltp/include/ltp-make.include

 - add "patch-inc" to patch section, i.e.:
   patch: patch-inc
       #YOUR OWN PATCHES
       $(PATCH) < blabla.patch
   or if you are 100% sure you don't need generic patches, you can just
   add "patch-critical" to patch section.

 - add "build-basic" or "build-all" to build section, depends on you:
   . are running a general test or cann't be sure which tests to build,
     you should add "build-all";
   . are 100% sure which sub tests you will build,
     you should add "build-basic", then add your own build commands, e.g.:
     build: build-basic
         make -C $(TARGET)/testcases/kernel/mem/hugetlb all
         make -C $(TARGET)/testcases/kernel/mem/hugetlb install

 - add "rh-tests-kernel-distribution-ltp-include" as RhtsRequires in METADATA

2. What you should put in your own runtest.sh:

  It's a little complex, basically, you should:

 - add this line to your runtest.sh:
 . /mnt/tests/kernel/distribution/ltp/include/runtest.sh

 - Others.... Hmmm..... have a look at:
   /kernel/distribution/ltp/generic/runtest.sh
   /kernel/vm/hugepage/ltp-hugetlbfs/runtest.sh
