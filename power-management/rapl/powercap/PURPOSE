Description: Simple test of powercap.
Author: Erik Hamera <ehamera@redhat.com>

RAPL = Running Average Power Limit

Check RAPL functions. It measures power consumption on idle and on full load on
all cores. Then it will cap it to the average power and measures power
consumption under full load again.

There are two magic constants in it:
- measure time is 30 seconds
- 10% maximal difference between measured and capped value until test is
  going to fail

These constants are __NOT__ emerging from intel's datasheets or something like
that. They __ARE__ just wild guess which should suppress false alarms due to
started daemons and other fluctuations. Feel free to change it if your guess
is better, than mine.
