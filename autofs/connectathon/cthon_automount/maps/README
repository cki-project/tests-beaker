Map templates provided in this subdirectory are only templates
used to construct the maps to be used during testing. The setup script will
read these maps, replace the AUTO_SERVER_DIR, SERVER1, SERVER2 and
AUTO_CLIENT_MNTPNT strings with the values specified in the 'src/tests.init'
file. The built maps will then be installed in the AUTOMAP_DIR directory.
 
The following maps are provided in the 'maps' subdirectory.
	auto_nested		- indirect map of nested autofs mountpoints
	auto.badnames		- indirect map with keys with bad names
	auto_dcthon		- direct map
	auto_test3_direct	- another direct map
	auto_test3_direct	- direct map to use with offset testing
	auto_icthon		- indirect map
	auto_octhon		- indirect map with interesting options
	auto_ecthon		- executable map
				  (only for autofs implementations)
	auto_master		- master map
 
The 'server_directories' file contains the name of the directories required
on the server. These are the server directories mounted by the automounter
during the tests. If you modify any of the maps, and add a new server path
to mount, you should add the complete path to this file so it can be
automatically created by the setup script.

All map names should start with 'auto_', since it's how the setup script
finds them to install them in the AUTOMAP_DIR directory.
