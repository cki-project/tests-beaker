# Makefile for the NIS databases
#
# This Makefile should only be run on the NIS master server of a domain.
# All updated maps will be pushed to all NIS slave servers listed in the
# /var/yp/ypservers file. Please make sure that the hostnames of all
# NIS servers in your domain are listed in /var/yp/ypservers.
#
# This Makefile can be modified to support more NIS maps if desired.
#

# Set the following variable to "-b" to have NIS servers use the domain
# name resolver for hosts not in the current domain. This is only needed,
# if you have SunOS slave YP server, which gets here maps from this
# server. The NYS YP server will ignore the YP_INTERDOMAIN key.
#B=-b
B=

# If we have only one server, we don't have to push the maps to the
# slave servers (NOPUSH=true). If you have slave servers, change this
# to "NOPUSH=false" and put all hostnames of your slave servers in the file
# /var/yp/ypservers.
NOPUSH=true

# yppush copies updated NIS databases (or maps) from the master NIS server 
# to the slave servers within a NIS domain and listens for their answer. 
# yppush will ask portmap to assign it a random port number to listen on 
# by default. To specify a fixed port number or any aditional options, 
# edit variable YPPUSH_ARGS.
# e.g. YPPUSH_ARGS = --port 836

# We do not put password entries with lower UIDs (the root and system
# entries) in the NIS password database, for security. MINUID is the
# lowest uid that will be included in the password maps. If you
# create shadow maps, the UserID for a shadow entry is taken from
# the passwd file. If no entry is found, this shadow entry is
# ignored.
# MINGID is the lowest gid that will be included in the group maps.
# You can either set values directly (e.g. MINUID=1000) or pick up
# current values from /etc/login.defs
