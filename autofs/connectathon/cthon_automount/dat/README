Each file contains a list of test items, with each test item consisting of
a path which exercises the automounter in different ways, and the expected
result for that path. Paths are absolute with respect to the root of the
filesystem, while the expected result should be either 0 (for expected success)
or 1 (for expected failure). Lines that begin with a '#' are considered to be
comments, and blank lines are ignored.
