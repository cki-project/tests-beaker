#duplicate entries will map successfully with the patch of this bug
#The first two bugs are rhel-6 and rhel-7 bugs, but subsequent imports
#from fedora over major releases won't contain these even though the
#change is present. So add an arbitrary rhel-8 bug so the exceptions
#still match.
#Beware, a similar change will be needed for rhel-9 and beyond assuming
#this change remains in the upstream code.
