Run stress-ng tests
  git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/stress-ng.git

Note: The timeout is per stressor, not the whole class.
Run 'stress-ng --class interrupt?' to see all the stressors
in the interrupt class.  Multiply the number of stressors
by the timeout to get the expected run time.

As of the V0.09.56 release, there are 289 total stressors in
the 5 classes interrupt, cpu, cpu-cache, memory, and os, so
the expected runtime is 144.5 minutes with a 30 sec timeout.

TASK PARAMETERS
---------------
CLASSES = list of stress-ng classes to run
          task default is: interrupt cpu cpu-cache memory os

TIMEOUT = timeout per stressor in seconds
          task default is 30 seconds
          (setting it longer than 30 seconds will require
           adjusting the expected runtime of the test)

EXTRA_FLAGS = extra command line args for stress-ng, e.g., --verbose
              task default is ""
