Run stress-ng tests
  git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/stress-ng.git

Note: If using classes, the timeout is per stressor, not the
whole class.  Run 'stress-ng --class interrupt?' to see all the
stressors in the interrupt class.  Multiply the number of
stressors by the timeout to get the expected run time.

This task uses a list of stressors (see the *.stressors files)
with a 5 second timeout (by default) for each.  There are 184
stressors, so 184 * 5 = expected runtime of 920 seconds.
