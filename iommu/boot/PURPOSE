This tests booting with various iommu kernel boot options, especially
ones that are known to cause issues booting like in BZ 908744. The
code is based on /kernel/cmdline

By default it uses a test included file with different boot options
'default-boot-options-{intel,amd}.txt' depending on whether the system
has an AMD or Intel processor. However you can override these if you pass
in CMDLINEARGS. Separate different boot options or sets of boot
options with a ":". For example:

CMDLINEARGS="intel_iommu=on"
or
CMDLINEARGS="intel_iommu=on iommu=pt:intel_iommu=on,pt64:iommu=on"
