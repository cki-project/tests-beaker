ABSTRACT MACHINE TEST UTILITY HOWTO


OVERVIEW

Abstract Machine Test Utility (AMTU) is an administrative utility to check 
whether the underlying protection mechanism of the hardware are still being 
enforced. This is a requirement of the Controlled Access Protection Profile 
(CAPP) FTP_AMT.1, see http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/protection_profiles/CAPP-1.d.pdf.
AMTU executes the following tests:

* Memory 

Randomly writes to areas of memory and then reading the memory back to 
ensure the values written remain unchanged.  
	  
* Memory Separation 

Ensures that user space programs cannot read and write to areas of memory 
utilized by the likes of Video RAM, kernel code, etc.

* I/O Controller - Network

Verifies random data transmitted is also the data received for each configured 
network device. Only ethernet and token ring devices that are configured and 
up are checked. Async devices are not checked.

* I/O Controller - Disk

Verifies that information written to disks remains unchanged.  Only SCSI and IDE
controllers associated with mounted filesystems are checked.

* Supervisor Mode Instructions

Ensures that the enforcement of the property that privileged instructions 
should only be in supervisor mode is still in effect. The set privileged 
instructions tested to confirm this is architecture dependant.



TESTED VERSIONS

AMTU has been tested on the following:

* SuSE SLES 8
* pSeries (32-bit and 64-bit)
* iSeries (64-bit)
* zSeries (31-bit)
* xSeries (32-bit)



INSTALLING AMTU

VERIFYING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND PREREQUISITES

Before installing AMTU, verify that your system meets the following 
requirements and prerequisites:

* The system is running the Common Criteria evaluated configuration of 
SuSE SLES 8. 


COMPILING AND INSTALLING AMTU

Untar the AMTU source tarball.  Then issue the following commands:
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	make install

Only the last step must be run as root. During the ./configure stage
you may opt to change various options including default install directory.

When compiling AMTU as a 64-bit application on a PPC64 architecture (with the
exception of Squadron pSeries), specify
 
	./configure CC=/opt/cross/bin/powerpc64-linux-gcc

where /opt/cross/bin/powerpc64-linux-gcc is the 64-bit gcc compiler.

To compile as a 64-bit application on X86_64 architecture or Squadron pSeries, 

	./configure CC="gcc -m64" 



RUNNING AMTU

AMTU installs to /usr/bin/amtu by default. You can add optional command line 
arguments (see the AMTU man page (amtu.8) for more details).



INTERPRETING RESULTS

AMTU issues the following return codes when executed:

	* -1 - Program abort error
	*  0 - Successful program completion

If the error is repeatable, you can re-run amtu with the -d option to get 
more information about the failure. The success or failure of AMTU is logged
in the audit log files (see auditd.8).
