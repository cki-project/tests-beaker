This test is designed to test basic kernel functionality.
It loads some kernel modules from a list of modules in a file and checks to see,if they have loaded and can be removed.
Architecture specific modules may be used by adding additional files to this test in the form of modules.
$arch where $arch is the name of the architecture the test is running on. 
If there is no architecture specific file the test will use the modules listed in modules.default.
For any RHEL release specific modules that don't match between releases create modules.rhel[345] file with release-specific modules listed in it.
These modules will be appended to default or arch-specific module list.
