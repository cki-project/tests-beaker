This is the NFS Connectathon test suite from the Linux Test Project (LTP) it
has been patched and configured to test CIFS both with and without unix extensions.

This is standalone test - both server and client are running locally.
It works very much like nfs/connectathon, but instead of mounting
nfs share, it mounts samba shared directory (see smb.conf)

1. setup server with unix extensions enabled
2. run connectathon
4. setup server without unix extensions
5. run connectathon

Possible issues:
Occasionally, samba service wouldn't start and it appeared to hang in
cups_reload_services() / cups_reload_printers() - so far no clue
what's causing it.
